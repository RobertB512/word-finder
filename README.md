# Word Finder

## How to play

This is a game where you find as many words as you can in a word given to you. You can use as many, or as few of the letters in the given word as you want.

There are two levels in this game, easy and normal. In easy, you can use each letter as many times as you want. In normal, you can only use each letter, at most, as many times as it appears in the given word.

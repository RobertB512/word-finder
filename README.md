# Word Finder

A simple HTML, SCSS, and Javascript word game. I started with CSS and Bootstrap, but wanted to give it a redesign using SCSS.

If you've ever heard of or played the game where you write a word down at the top of a piece of paper and find words in that word, this is that game. The list of words to find words in come from a list of words in a separate Javascript file. One of those word is randomly chosen from that list at the start of the game.

In order to verify the words that a user enters, I use an API.

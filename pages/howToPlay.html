			<article class="introduction-container">
				<p>
					In this game, you form words by rearranging letters from a word that's
					given to you.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are two levels in this game, easy and normal. In easy you can
					use each letter as many times as you want. In normal, you can only use
					each letter, at most, as many times as it appears in the word. Normal
					makes things more challenging, but also might make things more fun!
				</p>
				<p>
					You can change your level at anytime, but be warned, by changing the
					level you'll loose your progress and get a new word. There is a chance
					though you will get the same word again.

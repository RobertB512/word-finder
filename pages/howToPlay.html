				<p>
					In this game, you form words by rearranging letters from a word that's
					given to you.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are two levels in this game, easy and normal. In easy you can
					use each letter as many times as you want. In normal, you can only use
					each letter, at most, as many times as it appears in the word. Normal
					makes things more challenging, but also might make things more fun!
				</p>
				<p>
					You can change your level or generate a new word at anytime, but be warned, by changing the
					level or generating a new word, your progress will be lost and a new word will be generated.

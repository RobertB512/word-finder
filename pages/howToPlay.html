			<article class="introduction-container">
				<p>
					In this game, you form words by rearranging letters from a word that's
					given to you.
				</p>

        <p>As you make words, you'll also get points for each letter in those word. The points from each word you make will be added to your points total. If you want to know how many points each letter is worth, think of Scrabble, each letter in this game has the same value as in Scrabble. In this game though, you won't get double letter, double word, triple letter, triple word, etc. point multipliers.
        </p>

				<p>
					There are two levels in this game, easy and normal. In easy you can
					use each letter as many times as you want. In normal, you can only use
					each letter, at most, as many times as it appears in the word. Normal
					makes things more challenging, but also might make things more fun!
				</p>

				<p>
					You can change your level or generate a new word at anytime, but be warned, by changing the
					level or generating a new word, your progress will be lost, your total words found and total points, and a new word will be generated.
				</p>

        <p>
          <b>NOTE:</b> To verify rather entered words are real words, I use a source on another computer somewhere in the world. Due to what I'm guessing is a bug on that end, there are some words, and common ones, that this game will count as not being real words. If this happens to you, no need to retry the word, unless your double checking your spelling, I know about the issue, just enjoy the game!
